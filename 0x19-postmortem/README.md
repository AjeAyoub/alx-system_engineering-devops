Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from April 10th, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC to April 11th, 2024, at 2:00 AM UTC, lasting approximately 16 hours.

Impact: The outage affected our main web application, resulting in complete unavailability for all users. Approximately 80% of our user base experienced service disruption, leading to frustration and potential loss of business.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a database failure due to a misconfigured replication setup, leading to data inconsistencies and performance degradation.

Timeline:

10:00 AM UTC, April 10th: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in database latency and error rates.

10:15 AM UTC, April 10th: Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a database-related problem due to the symptoms observed.

11:30 AM UTC, April 10th: Initial investigation focused on database servers, including checking for hardware failures and network issues. No abnormalities were found.

1:00 PM UTC, April 10th: As database performance continued to degrade, engineers escalated the incident to the database administration team for further analysis.

3:00 PM UTC, April 10th: Misleading assumptions led to investigating application code for potential bugs, consuming valuable time and resources.

6:00 PM UTC, April 10th: With no resolution in sight, the incident was escalated to senior management and the DevOps team for additional support.

12:00 AM UTC, April 11th: After extensive troubleshooting and collaboration, the root cause was identified as a misconfigured database replication setup causing data inconsistencies and performance issues.

2:00 AM UTC, April 11th: The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the database replication and performing data integrity checks to ensure consistency.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfigured database replication setup resulted in data inconsistencies and degraded performance. Specifically, incorrect configuration settings led to replication lag and conflicts between primary and replica databases.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the database replication setup to ensure consistency between primary and replica databases. Additionally, data integrity checks were performed to identify and reconcile any inconsistencies.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring for database replication lag and consistency checks.
Enhance documentation and training for database administrators on replication setup and configuration best practices.
Tasks:
Patch and update database replication software to the latest version to mitigate known issues.
Conduct regular audits of database configuration settings to identify and address potential misconfigurations.
